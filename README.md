Keyboard only (incl. PC-XT) variant: https://github.com/No0ne/ps2pico

[PicoMiteVGA](https://geoffg.net/picomitevga.html) variant: https://github.com/No0ne/hid2cdc

[PiKVM](https://pikvm.org) integration:
* https://docs.pikvm.org/pico_hid/
* https://docs.pikvm.org/pico_hid_bridge/

# Usage
* Download `ps2x2pico.uf2` from https://github.com/No0ne/ps2x2pico/releases
* Copy `ps2x2pico.uf2` to your Pi Pico by pressing BOOTSEL before pluggging in.
* 3.3V/5V conversion is done using a bi-directional level shifter: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bi-directional-logic-level-converter-hookup-guide/
* Afterwards connect a USB keyboard and/or mouse using an OTG-adapter and optional USB hub.
* Also works with wireless keyboards and mice with a dedicated USB receiver.


⚠️ Please note that some older motherboards have non-resettable fuses rated
under 300mA.

**Check the power consumption of your keyboard/mouse/hub first before plugging
in!**

⚠️ Do not assume wire colors will match cables depicted in photos. Double-check
your pinout with a multimeter.

# Troubleshooting
You can hook up a USB serial adapter to **GPIO0** for additional debugging output. The serial settings are **115200** baud, **8** data bits and **no parity**. You can also use another Pico running the [pico-uart-bridge](https://github.com/Noltari/pico-uart-bridge) for this.


⚠️ If you have a **YD-RP2040** (see silkscreen on back of board if unsure) and
are not using a USB hub with its own power supply, you need to bridge two pads
of the diode pair near the USB-C port as seen here:

# Build
(update to the latest TinyUSB release first)
```
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk
cd $PICO_SDK_PATH/lib/tinyusb
git checkout 0.16.0

cd /path/to/ps2x2pico
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
