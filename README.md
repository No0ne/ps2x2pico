Keyboard only (incl. PC-XT) variant: https://github.com/No0ne/ps2pico  
There is also an alternative ps2pico firmware for the PC-XT and ps2x2pico hardware: [ps2pico-XT-alt.uf2](https://github.com/No0ne/ps2pico/releases/tag/2.1)

[PicoMiteVGA](https://geoffg.net/picomitevga.html) variant: https://github.com/No0ne/hid2cdc

[PiKVM](https://pikvm.org) integration:

* https://docs.pikvm.org/pico_hid_bridge/

[ITX-Llama](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=93480) integration:

# Usage
* Download `ps2x2pico.uf2` from https://github.com/No0ne/ps2x2pico/releases
* Copy `ps2x2pico.uf2` to your Pi Pico by pressing BOOTSEL before pluggging in.
* 3.3V/5V conversion is done using a bi-directional level shifter: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bi-directional-logic-level-converter-hookup-guide/
* Afterwards connect a USB keyboard and/or mouse using an OTG-adapter and optional USB hub.
* Also works with wireless keyboards and mice with a dedicated USB receiver.


⚠️ Please note that some older motherboards have non-resettable fuses rated
under 300mA.

**Check the power consumption of your keyboard/mouse/hub first before plugging
in!**

⚠️ Do not assume wire colors will match cables depicted in photos. Double-check
your pinout with a multimeter.

# PS/2 passthru
If you also want to use a real PS/2 keyboard and mouse together with your USB devices you can mount another level shifter on top of the pico. These two ports work as PS/2 inputs and are passed through to the PS/2 output ports.
* GPIO3 LV1 - keyboard data
* GPIO4 LV2 - keyboard clock
* GPIO5 LV - 3.3V pull-up
* GND - GND
* GPIO6 LV3 - mouse data
* GPIO7 LV4 - mouse clock

Don't forget to wire HV to 5V and your PS/2 sockets to power the connected PS/2 devices.

PS/2 passthru is especially useful with the PiKVM [Pico HID](https://docs.pikvm.org/pico_hid/) or [Pico HID Bridge](https://docs.pikvm.org/pico_hid_bridge/) as you can continue using your existing peripherals.  
⚠️ Please note that the [UF2 from PiKVM](https://github.com/pikvm/kvmd/releases) uses different GPIOs due to jumper pins:
* GPIO26 LV1 - keyboard data
* GPIO27 LV2 - keyboard clock
* GPIO16 LV3 - mouse data
* GPIO17 LV4 - mouse clock

Don't forget to wire LV to 3.3V and GND to GND separately as the level shifter does not fit directly on top of the pico. 

# Troubleshooting
You can hook up a USB serial adapter to **GPIO0** for additional debugging output. The serial settings are **115200** baud, **8** data bits and **no parity**. You can also use another Pico running the [pico-uart-bridge](https://github.com/Noltari/pico-uart-bridge) for this.

⚠️ If you have a **YD-RP2040** (see silkscreen on back of board if unsure) and
are not using a USB hub with its own power supply, you need to bridge two pads
of the diode pair near the USB-C port as seen here:

# Build

Install needed libraries and tools:

```sh
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libusb-1.0-0
```

Get the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK version 1.5.1:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk
cd $PICO_SDK_PATH
git checkout 1.5.1
git submodule update --init
```

Update to the latest TinyUSB release 0.17.0:
```sh
cd $PICO_SDK_PATH/lib/tinyusb
git checkout 0.17.0
```

Generate the UF2 file:
```sh
cd /path/to/ps2x2pico
git submodule update --init
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
